To process field data, you will want to mainly use the scripts located in the ‘process’ folder, with the main file being ‘phaseimgproc_t_gland.m’. 

To simulate profiles from an input array beam pattern, you will want to mainly use the scripts located in the ‘profile_synth’ folder, with the main file being ‘profileRecreation.m’. 

You are able to plot the outputs of both field and simulated data using the plotting scripts located in the ‘plotting’ folder. ‘plottingfancies_gland.m’ shows you some examples of plotting data, although some parts of this are outdated and may not run.
